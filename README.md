##### Anomalies. Anna Molly.

Anomaly Detection is the practice of identifying data points, items, observations or events that do not conform to the expected pattern of a given group.

### What are Anomalies?

- Anomaly - Anomalies are the unusual, unexpected, surprising patterns in the observed world. An anomalous data point is a deviation from a rule or from what is regarded as normal; an outlier. An anomaly is any event or measurement that is out of the ordinary regardless of whether it is exceptional or not.
- Outlier - An outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from a population. In a sense, this definition leaves it up to the analyst (or a consensus process) to decide what will be considered abnormal. Before abnormal observations can be singled out, it is necessary to characterize normal observations. - [NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section1/prc16.htm)
- The terms "outlier" and "anomaly" are frequently used interchangeably.
- In some cases, statisticians sometimes use the term 'outlier' to mean "something I should remove from the dataset so that it doesn't skew my model I'm building".
- In other cases, we may reserve the word 'anomaly' for data points we want to keep because they are valuable if caught or costly if missed. It's also possible to have an anomaly that is an inlier, meaning that the data is anomalous in nature but is close (in distance) to the mean, mode, or expected grouping(s).
